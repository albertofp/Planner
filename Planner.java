    /*
    You need to code a planner for meetings.
The idea is that you input the different meetings + how long they take, and your code will give you the best planned schedule for this
- A day starts at 8am and finishes at 12pm 
- 12pm is 1h lunch break
- the feedback round can start not earlier than 4pm and not later than 5pm, everyday ends with a feedback round
- Input is supposed to look like "Meeting 30min" or "Meeting Blitz" (Blitz = 10min)
- no need to leave gaps inbetween meetings
- If one day is full, the next day will be used
- Output is supposed to look like
Day 1
08:00AM Meeting 30min
    

    1. Input: Add new meeting (Time, duration)
    2. 5 days, 8:00-12:00, 13:00-00:00
    3. Feedback round: start between 16:00 and 17:00, once every day
    4. If day full -> add to next day
    5. Show output table
